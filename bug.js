This bug occurs when using the Expo Constants API to access device-specific information, specifically the `deviceId` property.  The issue arises when the app is running on an emulator or simulator, where the `deviceId` is often null or undefined. This can cause unexpected crashes or errors in applications that rely on a unique identifier for features such as user authentication or data synchronization.
